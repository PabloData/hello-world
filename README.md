I'm a marketing student in my twenties based in Montreal and I'm starting to get really interested by Data Science.
On GitHub I'll hopefully find the ressources and tools I need to turn my ideas into reality!

If you are reading this it means you have heard about me or my projects and are looking through all of my pages... make yourself at home!

Additional research required on:
- Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) neural network for semi supervised anomaly detection
- "statistical surprise"
- Kaplan meier curve and "death estimation" to estimate customer fidelity and create retention algorithms. What segment or cluster of clients is the best recipient of investment money to ensure the best long term profitability.
- URaiden token offchain payment channels verified periodically on Blockchain.
